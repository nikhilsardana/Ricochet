The game is simple! There's a ball in the middle of the screen, which you want to get to the edge (the blue part)

Don't touch the spikes!</br>
Swipe the screen to create lines so the ball "ricochets" off, changing directions.

The different line colors correspond to different speeds.</br>
Some colors are faster than others, and the effects multiply and can get crazy fast!</br>
You have ten swipes per level, so work quickly!
